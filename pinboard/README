Just a quick write up of how to get this up and running.

-> Place/upload the contents of the zip to your desired location.
(this file and the agpl-3.txt aren't needed for operational use, but you knew that.)

You should be good to go!

No? Then read on.

-> Not happy with the paths of stuff? (the images/pb.txt)
Well that's okay, open pinboard.php in a text editor and you'll see:
	$PB_FILE = "pb.txt";
	$IMGS_PATH = "images/";
Just change the values to how you want it/have it.


-> If you change the $IMGS_PATH then you also need to edit the pb.css file to reflect this.
Change the path for the input's background:
	input {
		/*stuff*/
		background: url(images/button.png) center no-repeat;
		/*stuff*/
	}
Annoying extra step, I know.


-> You can also change the time zone the script uses, default is GMT.
	date_default_timezone_set('GMT');
Time is used to record when a message was posted and is only used internally.


-> You can change the size of the area where you can post messages inside by editing:
	$BOARD_SIZE_X = 2000;
	$BOARD_SIZE_Y = 2000;
The size uses pixels. (Hi, I'm Mr Obvious!)


-> How do I remove unwanted messages?
You'll need to edit the $PB_FILE, just remove the line with the message you dont want.


-> Can I post URLS?
Yes, but only if you edit the $PB_FILE, posting urls from the pinboard is not allowed
since spammers would have a field day.
the BBcode is [url=URL]TEXT[/url] or just [url]URL[/url].


-> I'm a better coder than you, would you like some help? (etc)
Yeah, sure why not.


-> This README sucks.
Yup, but pinboard is pretty straight forward anyway so why are you reading this?
